# Mech105-Algorithm
Algorithms I created on MATLAB for different numerical methods 

## Algorithms I created

**Binary Converter**

In this algorithm, I designed a code for MATLAB to turn any ordinary base 10 number into a base 2 number

**False Position**

This algorithm is a root finding meathod for a function that takes two initial guesses and uses an equation to combine them to find antother more accurate root guess

**LU Factorization**

This algorithm takes a matrix and pulls it apart and creates new matrices from it that tell you information about the system of equations you are presented with 

**Simpson 1/3 Rule**

This algorithm is a root finding meathod related to the Trapizoidal Rule that takes three or more initial guesses (must be off) and creates a new curve off of those points that gives you informaiton about your original function.
