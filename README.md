# Mech105-Algorithm
Algorithms I created on MATLAB for different numerical methods 

## Algorithms I created

**Binary Converter**

In this algorithm, I designed a code for MATLAB to turn any ordinary base 10 number into a base 2 number

**False Position**

This algorithm is a root finding meathod for a function that takes two initial guesses and uses an equation to combine them to find antother more accurate root guess
