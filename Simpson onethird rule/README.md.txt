**Simpson 1/3 Rule**

This algorithm is a numerical method related to the Trapezoidal Rule that takes three or more points (must be odd) and creates a new curve off of those points that gives you information about the integral of the original function. These points lye on the original function but they connect to form a new line that is easier to integrate than the original function.

*Inputs*
- an x vector (equally space independent variable)
- a y vector (function values with respect to x)


*Outputs*
- the numerical integral of the given function over the given points
